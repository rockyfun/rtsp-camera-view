Fix your camera IP address
To determine the IP address of your IP camera, connect to your router and watch for DHCP client list.

You should create an address reservation on router or config a static IP on your camera.

ONVIF parameters
Download an "Onvif Device Manager" https://sourceforge.net/projects/onvifdm/

Install it and run. It will show you the list of your Onvif sources. Choose desirable camera. If you will see an error about authentication, enter your Login and Password at the top of window and press "Log In".

Click "Live Video" in the middle. On the right you will see your camera video, below the video there is a string to connect your camera over RTSP.

For example: rtsp://192.168.0.4:554/live/main

If this string won't work, add some creditionals to URL:

rtsp://admin:mypass@192.168.0.4:554/live/main

RTSP streaming
You can use VLC to show this stream.

You can play URL in VLC: Open "Media" - "Open network stream" - "Network", put your URL here, "Play".
You can add URL to VLC shortcut:
"C:\Program Files (x86)\VideoLAN\VLC\vlc.exe" rtsp://admin:mypass@192.168.0.4/live/main

You can also add command line parameter "--aspect-ratio 16:9"
RTSP multi streaming
Add all your cameras to rtsp-camera-view and manage it manually.
